  <sec:Introduction>
    <section title="Overview" id="ppoverview">
      The scope of this Protection Profile (PP)‐Module is to describe the security functionality of a specific type
      of Peripheral Sharing Device (PSD) product in terms of Common Criteria for Information Technology
      Security Evaluation, cc:2022, Release 1 [CC] and to define functional and assurance requirements for
      such products.<h:br/><h:br/>
      A Target of Evaluation (TOE) claiming conformance to this PP‐Module must also claim conformance to the
      Peripheral Sharing Device Protection Profile (PSD PP) as its Base‐PP. This is because the PSD PP is a generic
      Protection Profile aimed at defining baseline requirements and Evaluation Activities for a wide variety of
      PSD products, but more specific requirements and Evaluation Activities apply depending on the types of
      physical and logical interfaces a PSD includes. Therefore, this PP‐Module defines additional Security
      Functional Requirements (SFRs) for security functionality unique to a PSD that supports peripheral audio
      output devices.

    <section title="Compliant Targets of Evaluation" id="TOEdescription">
      A compliant Target of Evaluation (TOE) for this PP‐Module is any PSD that supports connectivity between
      one or more computers and one or more analog audio output peripheral devices. All of the requirements
      and restrictions that are defined in the PSD PP apply to a conformant TOE. A conformant TOE satisfies all
      of the specific data protection/isolation capabilities that are required by the PSD PP.<h:br/><h:br/>
      A conformant TOE embodies one or more of the use cases defined in the PSD PP. It may also provide PSD
      functionality for additional types of computer interfaces (e.g., display, keyboard/mouse, user
      authentication device). In such a case, the TOE must claim conformance to all applicable PP‐Modules to
      the PSD PP.<h:br/><h:br/>
      In general, computer audio may be routed in various ways:<h:ul>
        <h:li>Analog audio signals</h:li>
        <h:li>Digital audio embedded in the video stream or independent digital audio (e.g., Sony/Philips Digital
          Interface Format, or S/PDIF)</h:li>
        <h:li>USB audio peripheral devices</h:li>
      </h:ul>
      Analog audio output requires special attention during TOE design as it may introduce analog leakage
      concerns. There is an additional concern an attacker may be able to use an audio output device
      as a low gain
      microphone for eavesdropping on the surrounding area or bridging an air‐gap to nearby computers.
      Analog audio output presents few security problems with respect to switching, since the person listening
      to the audio must be authorized to hear the output of all the connected computers. And in some
      operational environments, it is required that the user be able to hear more than one channel at a time.<h:br/><h:br/>
      Digital audio embedded in a video stream or passed through separate lines is not a security concern for
      this PP‐Module since it does not introduce analog signal leakage vulnerabilities. The capability for digital
      video is addressed in the PP‐Module for Video/Display Devices.<h:br/><h:br/>
      USB audio devices (i.e., codecs) are not authorized for use with the TOE. USB audio codecs have
      configuration memory that may be exploited to enable unauthorized data flows.
    </section>      
      <section title="TOE Boundary" id="TOEboundary">
        The TOE boundary is the same as for a Peripheral Sharing Device in general. Refer to the PSD PP for an
        outline of the TOE boundary. Note that a TOE that claims conformance to this PP‐Module must specifically
        include support for analog audio output peripherals. A TOE that claims conformance to this PP‐Module is
        not prevented from claiming conformance to other PSD PP‐Modules. All relevant PP‐Modules must be
        claimed by the TOE based on the specific types of peripheral device functionality provided.
      </section>      
    <section title="Use Cases" id="usecases">
      No additional use cases are defined for this PP‐Module. The TOE is expected to embody one or more use
      cases as defined by the PSD PP. The functionality defined by this PP‐Module is implementation-dependent
      (i.e., not tied to any specific use cases) and is related entirely to the specific security
      requirements related to security of the physical and logical interfaces for analog audio output devices.

  <sec:Security_Problem_Definition>    
      This PP‐Module describes the security problem in terms of the threats the TOE is expected to address,
      assumptions about its operational environment, and any organizational security policies (OSPs) that the
      TOE is expected to enforce.<h:br/><h:br/>
      Note that as a PP‐Module of the PSD PP, all threats, assumptions, and Organizational Security Policies (OSP)
      defined in the base PP will also apply to the TOE unless otherwise specified.

        When a TOE claims compliance to this PP‐Module, it is necessary to make claims in the PSD PP
        requirements that are consistent with the functionality provided by the PP‐Module. The following sections
        describe any PSD PP claims that must be made when the TOE boundary includes the functionality
        described by this PP‐Module. Note that for some requirements, only certain individual elements within
        the SFR have been modified for this PP‐Module. Any SFR elements that were omitted from the selections
        below are to be included in a conformant ST unmodified from their definition in the PSD PP.

              This SFR adds a requirement to block electrical signals that strengthens but

              <note role="application">
                This SFR is refined from the PSD PP for this PP‐Module to include further
                restrictions on how data may be routed in regards to interfaces selected by the
                user.<h:br/><h:br/>
                This SFR is refined from the PSD PP for this PP‐Module to include further
                restrictions for electrical signals. Electrical signals are considered not to flow
                between connected computers and data is considered not to transit the TOE if no
                signal greater than 45dB of attenuation at the extended audio frequency range is
                received. It is very unlikely that this element can be satisfied unless all unselected
                computer interfaces are shorted to ground by the TSF.<h:br/><h:br/>
                Note that the above port‐to‐port attenuation pass criterion is calculated based on
                the following: 45 dBv = 177.82 signal to voltage ratio. When the signal inserted
                on one TOE computer interface audio input is 2.00 V peak‐to‐peak sine wave, the
                maximum allowed output signal voltage measured at another TOE computer
                interface is therefore 11.2mV (or well below noise level). Negative swing is
                measured when the generated audio signal average voltage is 0V.<h:br/><h:br/>
                If the peripheral interface supports multiple signals (such as right and left audio,
                or audio bias), then all those supported signals should comply with the above
                SFRs.<h:br/><h:br/>
                If the TOE claims conformance to multiple PP‐Modules, each PP‐Module modifies
                this SFR in a different manner for the interfaces that are unique to that module. In
                this case, the ST author should reference this modification of the SFR as
                “FDP_APC_EXT.1/AO” for uniqueness. Note that all elements of FDP_APC_EXT.1
                must be included in this iteration, not just the ones that are modified by this PP-Module.

              unidirectionally from the [<h:i>TOE analog audio output computer</h:i>] interface to the
              [<h:i>TOE analog audio input computer interface</h:i>].

            <note role="application">
              For audio signals, the TOE analog audio output computer interface is
              considered to be unidirectional if it receives no signal greater than 45 dB of
              attenuation at the extended audio frequency range. It is very unlikely that this
              element can be satisfied unless all unselected computer interfaces are shorted
              to ground by the TSF.<h:br/><h:br/>
              If the peripheral interface supports multiple signals (such as right and left
              audio, or audio bias), then all those supported signals should comply with the
              above SFR.

                The evaluator shall examine the Isolation Documentation to determine that it describes how the TOE
                enforces audio output data flow isolation from other TOE functions, such that the audio output peripheral
                interface is unidirectional and no data can be routed from a connected peripheral back to a connected
                computer. The description shall ensure the signal attenuation between any TOE audio output peripheral
                device interface and any other TOE computer audio output interface is at least 45 dB measured with a 2V
                input pure sine wave at the extended audio frequency range, including negative swing signal.

                Note: Data is considered not to transit the TOE if no signal greater than 45 dB of attenuation at the specific
                audio frequency is received.<h:br/><h:br/>
                The evaluator shall perform the following test.

  <appendix title="Required Supplementary Information" id="req-supp-info">
    This Supporting Document refers in various places to the possibility that ‘supplementary information’ may
    need to be supplied as part of the deliverables for an evaluation. This term is intended to describe
    information that is not necessarily included in the Security Target or operational guidance, and that may
    not necessarily be public. Examples of such information could be a Letter of Volatility or isolation
    documentation. The requirement for any such supplementary information will be identified in the
    relevant PP, PP‐Module, or Supporting Document.<h:br/><h:br/>
    The PSD PP requires an Isolation Document to be included with the TOE for evaluation of isolation
    requirements. The EAs the evaluator is to perform are captured under the appropriate SFR.
